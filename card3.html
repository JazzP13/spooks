                Angeles is home to an age-old image of the dead Christ, known as Apung Mamacalulu (Lord of Mercy). Apu is the most important figure of veneration by Angeleos as it is believed to be miraculous. Proof of this is the story of Roman Payumo, a farmer, who, while gathering grass for his animals, was captured by the Spaniards and suspected to be a Katipunero. The hapless native was interrogated, tortured, and then sentenced to die by musketry.</p>
               <br>
                <p>On October 25, 1897, Payumo, bound tightly in ropes, was led to his place of execution. As the retinue passed by Sto. Rosario Church, the desperate prisoner was moved to cry out to Apu Oh, My God, turn your merciful gaze upon me! Please arise from your recline and come out to me! Embrace me tightly and enfold me with your holy robe and save me, and cast away my executioners! Suddenly, the rope loosened and Payumo, realizing he was miraculously untied, made a mad dash for freedom.<br> The Spanish guards pursued him, but he disappeared from sight. It turned out Payumo fell into a 30-meter-deep locust trap that hid him from his captors until he crawled out to safety after a few days. Payumos experience signaled the beginning of an intense popular Apu devotion from that time on.
