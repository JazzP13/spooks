        <h1>The Vanishing of a Banahaw Hermi</h1>
    <br>
        <div class="parag">
            <p>
                In mystical Banahaw, Agrifino Mamay Pinoy Lontok is regarded as the first hermit to be commanded by Santong Boses (mountain spirit) to safeguard the secrets of the mountain including its most sacred places.<br>
                One such location is the so-called Santong Jacob, a cave with a bottom that can only be accessed by crawling through a tight, dark crevice. Devotees must dip themselves thrice in a well in the cave's floor to be purified.</p>
                <p>It was in this cave that Mamay Pinoy immersed himself in the well; then, he suddenly felt weak and unable to move. Next thing he knew, he was being sucked under the water and vanished only to resurface on dry land.<br>
                Mamay Pinoy had entered the realm of the enchanted.<br>
                His initial disappearance worried his family until he returned to tell his fantastic time in encanto land where a day was equal to three earth days. His daughter Cristeta, who was 73 in 1986, would relate that her father would routinely vanish for days and then suddenly appear again through the same well. It was her father who first declared Mount Banahaw as a sacred mountain.
