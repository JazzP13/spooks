                Entering Clark Air Base in Pampanga through the Mabalacat gate, one encounters a trio of towering aguso trees (from the pine family), about 45 to 50 feet tall. Known as Tres Marias (Three Marys) by Clark residents, they are linked to unexplained events, mostly vehicular accidents, that have been reported for many years. An incident report from the period July 2010 to 2015 recorded 298 accidents occurring in the areaa rather unusual number.Many people attribute these tragic events to the trees which they believed to be cursed. Oldtimers say that this was the place where the bodies of three women, violated and then killed years ago, were buried. The trees, they say, are a dwelling place of animals of extraordinary sizes, and people have reported sightings of a giant cow, dog, and wolf. This concept goes back to our pre-colonial animist religion, in which plants and trees are believed to be abodes of spirits and animals. Thus, any kind of disturbance against these sacred plants merits punishments depending on the gravity of the action. For this reason, car drivers must ask permission first before entering the spirits territoryby honking their horn and making the sign of the cross as they pass the mysterious Tres Marias.
