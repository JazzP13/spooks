                On December 6, 1966, the Virgin Mary allegedly appeared to 10-year-old Belinda Villas, who was on her way home from school, on a rocky hill on Cabra Island in Mindoro.</p>
                <p>The farmers daughter felt a tap on her shoulders and beheld a beautiful floating lady in a white garment with light-blue mantle and sash" whom she described to her friends as a madre. Eventually, Mercilita Cajayon, Dalisay Tameta, Edna Villas, Matilda Somintac, Mindadelia Tulaylay, Erlinda Villas, and Gloria Tulaylay witnessed the Lady, too.<br>
                News of the apparition spread nationwide, more so when Belinda revealed that Our Lady promised that a miracle would happen on March 25, 1968. Over 7,000 pilgrims from all over the Philippines came to Cabra that day.</p>
                <p>People claimed to have seen the Virgin appear at 4:30 a.m. and several eyewitness accounts included seeing the sun turning and changing its colors, a bright star on top of the tree near the chapel, and spinning like it was coming towards the people. The alleged apparitions continued until March 25, 1972. By then, the seers were living separate lives, some in Manila, others in Cabra. Public interest in the apparitions waned as political turmoil took over the country.
