                On June 4, 2015, strange, eerie sounds were heard from the skies in Lobo, Batangas at about 3 p.m. The trumpet-like sounds using them were recorded by Vincent Andy Magnaye for about seven to 10 minutes, which disturbed animals like birds and dogs. Some speculated that the sounds were caused by the wind, rumbling thunder, or from a power plant nearby. Others, however, took the trumpet-like sounds to be an apocalyptic sign, as mentioned in the Book of Revelations, in which seven trumpets were sounded from the skies by angels.The unusual occurrence, though, has also been reported around the world. NASA confirmed that the strange sounds heard around the world called tweeks, whistlers, and sferics are the earth's background noise, a natural radio emission.
