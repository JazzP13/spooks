                It was just another routine job for young laborer Crispino Lacandaso on March 23, 1922.<br>
                An ancient sampaloc tree had fallen down in a vacant lot at 1885 Juan Luna Street, Gagalangin, Manila and he was tasked to chop it down to little pieces. With a mighty heave, the young worker managed to cleave the trunk in two. When he parted the two pieces, Lacandaso was startled to find the distinct imprint of a cross standing on a base on both halves of the tamarind wood.</p>
                <p>Kambal na Krus was how the residents named the crosses, and their sensational discovery was regarded as a miracle, causing quite a stir in the small neighborhood. A makeshift chapel was quickly set up so people could venerate the two identical crosses. In time, the kambal na krus were encased in glass and metal, and are now enshrined in a concrete chapel along Raxabago Street, where devotees come on regular visits.
