        <h1>The Berbalangs of Cagayan Sulu</h1>
    <br>
        <div class="parag">
            <p>
                As early as 1896, stories were told about an island on Sulu Sea Mapun Island, whose old name was Cagayan Island inhabited by a group of humanoid beings known as Berbalangs.</p>
                <br>
                <p> The Berbalangs were described to have eyes with cat-like pupils whose spirits could escape from their bodies, as well as turn into a creature with wings.<br>
                    This, they do, when they hunt for food including living human beings.<br> The Berbalangs could be repelled either by exposing the human to a "coconut pearl," (a magic stone found inside a coconut), or by pouring lime juice on graves to deter the creatures from eating cadavers.
                A lieutenant of the British Navy named Ethelbert Forbes Skertchly visited the island where he met two rival chiefs who each wanted control of all the island villages, except one the village of the Berbalangs.<br> Skertchly explored the village with a guide but was surprised to see it abandoned. His guide, convinced that the Berbalangs were hunting, hid Skertchly among the tall grass next to the road. Skertchly not only heard the sound of flapping wings but also saw a lot of little dancing lights fly over his head. The next morning, hoping to find an explanation to the strange events, the two went over to the hut of an acquaintance, Hassan, whom they found lying dead with his face frozen in fear.
