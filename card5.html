        <h1>Clarita Villanueva and the Diabolical Thing</h1>
    <br>
        <div class="parag">
            <p>
                Clarita Villanueva was a 17-year-old illiterate child of an espiritista mother from Bacolod, who died when she was 12.<br>
                Clarita became a vagrant in Manila, which led to her being detained in jail by police in May 1953.<br>
                Thus began her ordeal involving a violent entity called The Thing. Its appearance was presaged by stones pelting her while in her cell. Next, she woke up to find her right leg wedged inexplicably in her wooden bed.</p>
                <p>When the guard came in to investigate, the wild-eyed Clarita pointed at The Thing perched on a beam over her head. The big, black, curly-haired Thing then promptly jumped on top of her and began biting her. As Clarita screamed in pain, prison officers who saw nothing, tried to calm the tormented girl. They asked her to pray before an altar in her cell, but, as Clarita recalled later, The Thing stood in front of her, blocking her view.</p>
                <p>Those who saw the incident were convinced she was devil-possessed. The medico-legal, Dr. Mariano Lara, first suspected that the girl was biting herself, but when he saw with his own eyes the teeth marks appearing on her arms, he changed his mind. This was witnessed by Arsenio Lacson, then Mayor of Manila. The attacks of The Thing came to an end when TV evangelist Pastor Lester Sumrall succeeded in casting out the demons from Clarita.
